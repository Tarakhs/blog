The beauty of Unix is rooted in its open source nature, and this is especially meaningful when compared to proprietary operating systems. The system bestows you with the freedom to experiment and customize the software to your own unique needs and preferences. Instead of spoonfeeding the user with the same process for every task, the open source community allows for greater creativity in problem solving and encourages people to think for themselves, a process that breaks the individual from the common path and makes them develop critical thinking.

With Unix you can find solutions to issues that you may encounter in a way that works for you, without being limited to cookie cutter processes. Plus, since it’s open source, you’re able to collaborate with other users to discuss and find solutions together. It also offers users more control over how they use their computer and how data is accessed. This is ideal for those who value their security and privacy as it allows them to create their own intricate systems that are tailored to their own specific needs.

At the end of the day, Unix is the OS of choice because it provides users with more control, creativity, and the chance to work together with others to devise the best solutions. With Unix, it’s the user who is in control and not some conglomerate.
