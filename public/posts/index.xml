      <description>The beauty of Unix is rooted in its open source nature, and this is especially meaningful when compared to proprietary operating systems. The system bestows you with the freedom to experiment and customize the software to your own unique needs and preferences. Instead of spoonfeeding the user with the same process for every task, the open source community allows for greater creativity in problem solving and encourages people to think for themselves, a process that breaks the individual from the common path and makes them develop critical thinking.</description>

The idea of designing tools and software that focus on the user and the user&amp;rsquo;s needs is a powerful concept.</description>
