<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t describe my life as &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo;, sort to say, but the definition of that particular word has changed with time or context. People in general, I find, tend to cling to the letters that make up a particular word, instead of what it represents. Such words can be the words &ldquo;usability&rdquo;, &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, &ldquo;interests&rdquo;, and, for the sake of the example, &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo;. One of the many things that have had a large impact on my outlook recently has been exactly that.</p>
<p>What makes a productive person? If he has a schedule, a 7 am routine, if he dresses smartly? What makes &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, anyway? Dilemmas and problems exists for workarounds to be invented, but why is it so enforced to feel horrible about yourself if you aren&rsquo;t productive in a conventional way? Maybe someone is not made for 9-5&rsquo;s, or index funds, or corpo etiquette. Maybe their way of providing should be made accessible aswell. It&rsquo;s not two sides of a coin; it&rsquo;s more like a funding sphere, with infinite sides, buttery smooth, a marble like amalgam of carpenters and painters and nurses and travellers and &hellip; The ever so inclined, in the know, &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; people out there are always keen to bash on &ldquo;NPCs&rdquo;, but what gives? And what seperates?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that one is required to be categorized as &ldquo;productive&rdquo; in order to not feel bad about themselves and their impact on the world. What is deemed as productive on our late stage Orwellian paranoia that is the 2020&rsquo;s, would be considered utterly useless in another non contemporary time period. What is &ldquo;being productive&rdquo; anyway and why do we care? Is utilizing web-based frameworks to build a front-end productive? Is learning about network infrastructure and zero day vulnerabilities in order to prevent cyber attacks productive? To the eyes of the blue-collared, bread-winning, cheap-house-bying baby boomer, clicking keys all day sure does not equal real work, but oh well. Does mind-numbing physical labour with a low skill ceiling equal good just because you are out of the house for extensive parts of the day? Or does flipping stocks in a tall brokerhouse building with sharp and tasty windows equal work, if we set aside the moral corruption?</p>
<p>The point is that it boils down to nothing at all. Don&rsquo;t feel bad because today you did not organize that kitchen cupboard, or missed a deadline. We are at the brink of collapse on all fundamentally recognized aspects of society, and the only thing that is left for us to do is to laugh at the absurdity of it all. You are not your work or your hobbies or whatever, and I say that not in a textbook nihilistic teenage angst kind of way, but in a way that all, but none, will understand everything and nothing, at the same time. After all, you make it yours and noone can take your thoughts away from you.</p>
